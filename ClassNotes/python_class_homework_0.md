# Repetitions
- Open a new and empty iPython notebook
- Create a list of strings that contains the first names of you and your close family members
- Access the third entry in that list
- Create a list of ages of family members
- *Using these two lists (not manually!)*, create a new list containing the names of those family members older than 30
- *With a dict comprehension and the `zip` operator*, construct a dict where keys are family names and values are ages

## Something to actually mildly warm up your brains for
- similarly to the list you have created above, and *using the dictionary you have just created*, construct a list of the ages of your family members whose last letter of their first name is an 'a'.

# Something new
Put some more thought into a simple experiment you want to conduct. It should be as boring and simple as possible, require only very few subjects, and simple stimuli (tip: words are very simple). Note that reaction times or ratings are the easiest to acquire, and in this context almost the only thing that can be made to work
